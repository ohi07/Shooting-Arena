## üõ† Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- [PyOpenGL](https://pypi.org/project/PyOpenGL/)  
- [PyOpenGL_accelerate](https://pypi.org/project/PyOpenGL-accelerate/) (optional but recommended)  
- GLUT (via `freeglut` or system OpenGL libraries)

Install dependencies with:
```bash

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
```bash
python Shooting-Arena.py
```

A window titled **"Shooting-Arena by Ohi"** will open.  
Fight enemies, practice aim, and survive as long as possible.

## üìä Gameplay Notes
- **Headshots**: Instant kill, every 2 headshots restore +10 HP (if below 100).  
- **Body shots**: Reduce enemy HP, kill after multiple hits.  
- **Grenades**: Explode after ~2 seconds or 3 bounces.  
- **Smoke**: Blocks vision and bullets passing through its radius.  
- **Enemy AI**: Enemies dodge, avoid arena edges, and fire back after player kills 10+ enemies.
